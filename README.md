## These are not official PKGBUILDs, though you may like to use them

Run the `install_all.sh` script to install all packages of the groups `cutefish-git` (these packages)

All of these packages will replace the 'older' (& likely more stable) packages installed through arch repositories.
All of these belong to the `cutefish-git` group ðŸ˜„

It is intentional to look like all have 90-95% exactly same PKGBUILDS, and hence **use as much substitutions with variable names as possible, instead of hardcoding the name/url.**
